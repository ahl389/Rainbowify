# Rainbowify

Turn all your HTML text into rainbows ðŸŒˆ

### Install

Easy peasy.

Download the script and drop a link at the bottom of your HTML file.

```html
<script src = "js/rainbow.js"></script>
```

Add the class `rainbow` to any element whose contents you want to be written in rainbow!

That's it! Want to change the colors from the default?

Add some config info:

```javascript
rainbow.config({
	colors: [<your hex code here>, <your hex code here>, <your hex code here>, <your hex code here>]
});
```

There's no limit on the number of colors you can add to the array. Must use hex codes.
